  # NEW: Parameters for the "Gating and Ranking" agent selection logic.
  relevance:
    # Stage 1: Gating - Only consider agents within this box in the ego-centric frame.
    # How far ahead to look for relevant agents (e.g., ~8 seconds at 10 m/s).
    max_longitudinal_dist: 80.0
    # How far behind to look (important for lane changes, being cut off).

# --- Trajectory & Time Horizon Configurations ---
# Defines the core prediction task.
trajectory:

    # a fraction of the total training steps, e.g., 1/10th or 1/5th.
    T_0: 100000 
    # The factor by which to increase the cycle length after each restart. T_mult > 1
